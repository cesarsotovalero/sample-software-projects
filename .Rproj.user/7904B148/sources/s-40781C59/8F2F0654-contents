SAMPLING SOFTWARE PROJECTS
==========================
(c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. 


Implementation of algorithms to sample software projects for empirical
research. The implementation is provided as an R package and provides
two functions: 

(1) Score a selection of software projects (sample) with respect to
how representative it is of a broader population. 

(2) Recommend additional projects from the broader population in order
to maximize the score from the previous step.

USAGE: How to compute the score?

This example below uses the Ohloh universe to score the Mozilla
Firefox project along the space (Lines of Code, Developers). The text
id ~ total_code_lines + twelve_month_contributor_count is R syntax and
commonly used to define models.

url <- "http://sailhome.cs.queensu.ca/replication/representativeness/masterdata.txt"
ohloh <- read.delim(url, header=T, na.strings=c("", "NA"))
sample <- ohloh[ohloh$name=="Mozilla Firefox",]
score <- score.projects(sample, universe=ohloh, id ~ total_code_lines + twelve_month_contributor_count)
The resulting total score is in score$score and the dimension scores are in score$dimension.score.


USAGE: How to select the next projects?

This example adds 10 more projects to the sample from the previous
example. The result is a data frame np$new.projects with the projects
to be added to the sample and the score object of the combined sample
np$score.

np <- next.projects(10, sample, universe=ohloh, id ~ total_code_lines + twelve_month_contributor_count)


USAGE: How to change the configuration?

Provide a list with the similarity functions. Values NA indicates that
the default similarity function should be used for a dimension. In the
example below the function custom.similarity will be used the first
dimension.

score <- score.projects(sample, universe=ohloh, id ~ total_code_lines + twelve_month_contributor_count, configuration=c(custom.similarity, NA))
