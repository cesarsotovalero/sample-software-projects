# USAGE: How to compute the score?
#   
# This example below uses the Ohloh universe to score the Mozilla
# Firefox project along the space (Lines of Code, Developers). The text
# id ~ total_code_lines + twelve_month_contributor_count is R syntax and
# commonly used to define models.

url <- "http://sailhome.cs.queensu.ca/replication/representativeness/masterdata.txt"
ohloh <- read.delim(url, header=T, na.strings=c("", "NA"))
sample <- ohloh[ohloh$name=="Mozilla Firefox",]
score <- score.projects(sample, universe=ohloh, id ~ total_code_lines + twelve_month_contributor_count)

# The resulting total score is in score$score and the dimension scores are in score$dimension.score.

# USAGE: How to select the next projects?
#   
# This example adds 10 more projects to the sample from the previous
# example. The result is a data frame np$new.projects with the projects
# to be added to the sample and the score object of the combined sample
# np$score.

np <- next.projects(10, sample, universe=ohloh, id ~ total_code_lines + twelve_month_contributor_count)
