# Sample software projects

This project aims to put in practice the tool described in the paper "Diversity in Software Engineering Research" published at ESEC/FSE 2013
(see https://github.com/SAILResearch/replication-diversity_software_engineering).
This tool is useful for selecting a representative subsample of elements in a dataset.
We use it for our experiments to fulfill two main requirements for the selection the software projects: diversity and representativeness.
Diversity refers to selecting a sample containing members of every subgroup in the population, and within the sample, the subgroups have roughly equal size.
Representativeness is achieved when the size of each subgroup in the sample is proportional with the size of each subgroup in the population.
